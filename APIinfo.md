# The Definitive Developer's Guide to the Action1 RMM API: Architecture, Endpoints, and Implementation

## Section 1: Foundational Architecture of the Action1 API

The Action1 Application Programming Interface (API) is engineered as a modern, REST-based interface designed to facilitate automation and integration with the Action1 endpoint management platform. A comprehensive understanding of its architectural principles is a prerequisite for developing robust and efficient applications. This section deconstructs the API's design, protocols, and critical access points.

### 1.1 RESTful Architecture and Design Principles

The Action1 API adheres to the architectural constraints of Representational State Transfer (REST), providing programmatic access to platform resources through a set of well-defined endpoints.[1] This architectural style promotes a stateless client-server communication model, which is a standard for scalable and maintainable web services. The API's implementation is predictable and aligns with established web standards by leveraging standard HTTP verbs for its Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations [1]:

*   **GET:** Used for retrieving existing resources, such as a list of endpoints or the details of a specific software package.
*   **POST:** Employed for creating new resources, like initiating a remote session or creating a new endpoint group.
*   **PATCH:** Utilized for applying partial updates or modifications to existing resources, such as changing an endpoint's name or comment.
*   **DELETE:** Used for the removal of resources, for instance, deleting an endpoint or a deployer from the system.

All data interchange, including request bodies and API responses, is formatted using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This lightweight, human-readable format ensures broad compatibility with a multitude of programming languages and development platforms.[1]

### 1.2 API Versioning and Regional Base URLs

The current stable version of the Action1 API is 3.0, which is explicitly included in the base path of all API endpoints (e.g., `/api/3.0/`).[2, 3] While the accompanying OpenAPI specification is labeled as version 3.1.0, this likely refers to the documentation version or minor, non-breaking changes to the underlying API structure; all development should target the `/api/3.0/` path for requests.[2]

A critical architectural consideration for any developer is the platform's multi-region infrastructure. Action1 operates distinct data centers to serve different geographical regions, and all API requests must be directed to the correct regional server that hosts the user's account tenancy. This is not merely a configuration detail but a fundamental prerequisite for establishing a successful connection. An application hardcoded to use a single region's URL will be entirely non-functional for users whose accounts are homed in other regions. Consequently, any application built upon this API must be designed to be region-aware, either by prompting the user for their region or by providing a mandatory configuration setting for it.[2, 4] The correct base URLs are essential for all subsequent API interactions.

**Table 1.1: Regional API Base URLs**

| Region | Base URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| North America (Global) | `https://app.action1.com/api/3.0` |
| Europe | `https://app.eu.action1.com/api/3.0` |
| Australia | `https://app.au.action1.com/api/3.0` |

## Section 2: The OAuth 2.0 Authentication and Authorization Framework

Access to the Action1 API is secured through a robust framework based on the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. This token-based system ensures that sensitive credentials are not transmitted with every request, enhancing the overall security of the integration. A meticulous implementation of the authentication and authorization workflow is the first step in any successful API interaction.

### 2.1 Generating API Credentials

Programmatic access to the API is authenticated using a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`, which function as a non-human equivalent of a username and password.[5] These credentials must be generated from within the Action1 web console by navigating to the `Configuration | Users & API Credentials` page and selecting `+ New API Credentials`.[4, 5]

During the creation process, a descriptive name must be provided for the credentials. Optionally, a specific role can be assigned, which directly links the API key to Action1's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, thereby limiting the scope of actions the key can perform.[5] It is imperative to note that the `Client Secret` is displayed only once at the moment of creation. It must be copied and stored in a secure location, such as a dedicated secrets manager, immediately. If the secret is lost, it cannot be recovered; the entire credential pair must be deleted and a new one generated.[4, 5]

### 2.2 The Token Acquisition Workflow (OAuth 2.0)

Action1 employs the OAuth 2.0 protocol to secure API access, providing a standardized and secure method for delegated authorization.[2, 6, 7] To begin interacting with the API, an application must first exchange its `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for a temporary access token.

This exchange is performed by making a `POST` request to the `/oauth2/token` endpoint. The request must be formatted precisely as follows [2, 3]:

*   **HTTP Method:** `POST`
*   **Endpoint:** `/oauth2/token`
*   **Header:** `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
*   **Body:** The body must be a URL-encoded string containing the credentials: `client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`

A complete `cURL` command serves as a practical example of this request [3]:

```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "client_id=CLIENT-ID&client_secret=CLIENT-SECRET" https://app.action1.com/api/3.0/oauth2/token
```

### 2.3 Understanding the Access Token Response

A successful authentication request will return a `200 OK` status code and a JSON object containing the access token and its associated metadata. This response must be parsed to extract the necessary information for subsequent API calls.[3]

**Table 2.1: Authentication Token Response Fields**

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `access_token` | String | The JSON Web Token (JWT) to be used for authenticating subsequent API calls. |
| `refresh_token` | String | A token that can potentially be used to obtain a new access token without re-authenticating with the client secret. The specific refresh token workflow is not detailed in the available documentation. |
| `expires_in` | Integer | The lifetime of the `access_token` in seconds. A common value is 3600, representing one hour. |
| `token_type` | String | The type of token issued, which will be "bearer". This value dictates how the token is used in the `Authorization` header. |

The `expires_in` field is particularly important for building resilient applications. The application's logic must account for token expiration by recording the time of issuance and proactively requesting a new token before the current one becomes invalid.

### 2.4 Using the Bearer Token for API Calls

Once the `access_token` has been obtained, it must be included in every subsequent API request to authenticated endpoints. The token is passed within the `Authorization` HTTP header, prefixed with the `token_type` ("Bearer") followed by a space.[2, 3]

The correct format for the header is: `Authorization: Bearer [access_token]`

For example, a `GET` request to list organizations would be structured as follows [3]:

```bash
curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT-TOKEN" https://app.action1.com/api/3.0/organizations
```

### 2.5 Authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Action1 platform integrates its API security with a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. When API credentials are created, they can be assigned a role that strictly defines the permissions and scope of operations they are authorized to perform.[5] This ensures that integrations adhere to the principle of least privilege, a cornerstone of modern security practices.

The platform's RBAC capabilities have evolved significantly, indicating a maturation to meet the complex security requirements of enterprise and Managed Service Provider (MSP) customers. Initially offering a set of fixed roles, recent platform updates have introduced fully customizable RBAC.[8] This allows administrators to create highly granular roles with specific permissions, such as a "patch only operator" that can manage updates but cannot access other system functions. This evolution from a basic permission model to a highly configurable one is a response to the need for stricter security controls in automated workflows. For developers, this means that applications should be designed to function with narrowly scoped API credentials rather than assuming access to an all-powerful "Enterprise Admin" key, thereby enhancing the security posture of the integration.## Section 3: Structuring API Requests and Handling Responses

Beyond authentication, constructing valid API calls requires a clear understanding of how to structure requests with various parameters and how to handle the resulting responses. This section provides a practical guide to request formatting, advanced data retrieval techniques, and filtering mechanisms.

### 3.1 Anatomy of an API Request

A typical request to the Action1 API is composed of several key components:

*   **Path Parameters:** These are mandatory variables embedded within the URL path itself, denoted by curly braces (e.g., `{orgId}`, `{endpointId}`). They must be replaced with the actual, unique identifiers of the resources being targeted.[2]
*   **Query Parameters:** These are optional key-value pairs appended to the end of the URL to modify the request, most commonly for filtering, sorting, or paginating results. The query string begins with a question mark (`?`), and multiple parameters are separated by an ampersand (`&`).[9]
*   **Request Body:** For `POST` and `PATCH` requests that create or modify data, the payload is sent in the request body. The Action1 API expects this payload to be in JSON format.[1]

### 3.2 Advanced Data Retrieval with the `fields` Parameter

To optimize data retrieval and reduce the number of required API calls, certain `GET` endpoints support an optional query parameter named `fields`. This parameter allows a developer to request extended information beyond the default set of fields returned for a resource.[10] While this can enrich the data in a single call, it is important to note that such enriched queries may have a slightly longer processing time on the server.[10]

The `fields` parameter accepts several distinct values:

*   `fields=*` (or URL-encoded as `fields=%2A`): Returns all available fields for the resource, including both the default and all extended fields.
*   `fields=#` (or URL-encoded as `fields=%23`): Returns only the default fields. This is the standard behavior if the `fields` parameter is omitted entirely.
*   `fields=field_name,field_name2`: Returns one or more specified extended fields in addition to the default set. For example, a request for software packages could use `fields=versions` to include detailed version information.[10]

A practical use case is retrieving a list of managed endpoints while simultaneously obtaining their patching status. By including `fields=*`, the response for each endpoint will be augmented with fields like `missing_critical_updates`.[10]

### 3.3 Filtering Data with Query Parameters

Many `GET` endpoints that return a list of resources support filtering to help narrow down the results to a more manageable and relevant subset. This is accomplished by adding specific query parameters to the request URL.[9]

The available query parameters and their valid values are unique to each API endpoint. The conceptual documentation on the main Action1 website explains the mechanism of filtering but directs developers to the formal API specification for the exact parameters applicable to a given endpoint.[9] This creates a somewhat fragmented documentation experience, where a developer must consult two separate sources to fully understand how to construct a complex query. This report aims to bridge that gap by consolidating this information in the endpoint reference in Section 4.

A clear example of filtering is provided for the updates endpoint. To retrieve only security updates that are classified as "important" and have not yet been approved, the following query would be used [9]:

```
.../updates/{organization_id}?security_severity=important&approval_status=new
```

### 3.4 Handling Responses and Errors

An application interacting with the API must be prepared to handle various types of responses. Successful requests are typically indicated by an HTTP status code in the `2xx` range (e.g., `200 OK`, `201 Created`). The response body for these requests will contain the requested data in JSON format.

Errors are communicated through status codes in the `4xx` range for client-side issues (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`) and the `5xx` range for server-side problems. The response body for an error will likely contain a JSON object with specific details about the error, which should be parsed and logged by the application for debugging and user feedback. Robust error handling is a critical component of a reliable integration.## Section 4: Comprehensive API Endpoint Reference

This section provides a detailed, function-by-function reference for the Action1 API, synthesized from the official OpenAPI specification and supplementary documentation. Each entry includes the HTTP method, URL path, a description of its purpose, and notes on relevant parameters or extended data capabilities.

The structure of the API endpoints reveals a deliberate architectural choice centered on multi-tenancy. The near-universal presence of the `{orgId}` path parameter in almost every endpoint is a direct reflection of the platform's design to serve MSPs and large enterprises with distinct departments or clients.[2, 11, 12] This enforcement of organizational partitioning at the API level has a profound implication for developers: any integrated application must be architected around the concept of a "current" or "selected" organization. State management must be organization-aware, as virtually no functionality can be accessed without first identifying and supplying a valid `orgId`.

### 4.1 Search

*   **`GET /search/{orgId}`**
    *   **Description:** Performs a quick search across the specified organization for reports, endpoints, and applications in the App Store. Note that this endpoint returns only a basic summary of matching objects; a subsequent call to the specific object's endpoint is required to retrieve full details.[2]

### 4.2 Endpoint Management

*   **`GET /endpoints/status/{orgId}`**
    *   **Description:** Checks the connection status of endpoints within the specified organization.[2]

*   **`GET /endpoints/agent-installation/{orgId}/{installType}`**

*   **`DELETE /endpoints/groups/{orgId}/{groupId}`**
    *   **Description:** Deletes an endpoint group. This does not delete the endpoints themselves.[2]

*   **`GET /endpoints/groups/{orgId}/{groupId}/contents`**
    *   **Description:** Lists all the endpoints that are currently members of the specified group.[2]
    *   **Extended Data:** This endpoint supports the `fields` parameter, allowing for the retrieval of extended data (e.g., `missing_critical_updates`) for all endpoints within the group in a single call.[10]

*   **`POST /endpoints/groups/{orgId}/{groupId}/contents`**
    *   **Description:** Manually modifies the membership of a group by adding or removing specific endpoints.[2]

*   **`DELETE /endpoints/deployers/{orgId}/{deployerId}`**
    *   **Description:** Deletes a Deployer from the Action1 platform.[2]## Section 5: The PSAction1 PowerShell Module: A High-Level Abstraction

While the REST API provides a powerful, language-agnostic interface, Action1 strongly and consistently recommends the use of its `PSAction1` PowerShell module for a "substantially simplified API scripting experience".[1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10] This heavy emphasis indicates that the primary audience for scripting and automation is expected to be comfortable within the Windows and PowerShell ecosystem. The module serves as a high-level abstraction layer, handling complex tasks like authentication and request formatting, allowing users to focus on their automation logic.

### 5.1 Rationale and Installation

The `PSAction1` module is designed to abstract away the underlying complexities of the REST API, such as the manual OAuth 2.0 token exchange workflow. It provides a set of intuitive cmdlets that map directly to common platform operations.

Installation is straightforward and follows standard PowerShell practices. The module is hosted on the public PowerShell Gallery and can be installed with a single command in an elevated PowerShell session [4]:

```powershell
Install-Module PSAction1
```

### 5.2 Configuration and Authentication

Before any operations can be performed, the module's session must be configured. This involves a three-step process that directly mirrors the foundational architectural principles of the API itself:

1.  **Set Region:** The API region corresponding to the user's account must be configured. This reinforces the critical importance of the platform's multi-region architecture.[4]

2.  **Set Credentials:** The `Set-Action1Credentials` cmdlet is used to provide the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. The module then handles the entire OAuth 2.0 token acquisition and renewal process automatically in the background, managing the session token's lifecycle for the user.[4, 13]
    
    ```powershell
    Set-Action1Credentials -APIKey <your_api_key> -Secret <your_secret>
    ```

3.  **Set Organization Context:** The `Set-Action1DefaultOrg` cmdlet is used to define the organizational scope for all subsequent commands in the session. This directly corresponds to the `{orgId}` path parameter required by the REST API, reinforcing the platform's multi-tenant design.[4, 13] The organization ID can be found in the URL of the Action1 web console.[13]
    
    ```powershell
    Set-Action1DefaultOrg -Org_ID <your_org_id>
    ```

### 5.3 Core Cmdlet Reference

The module simplifies the concepts of REST into a set of cmdlets that follow standard PowerShell verb-noun conventions. This makes the API more accessible to IT professionals who may not be expert software developers.[13]

**Table 5.1: PSAction1 Core Cmdlet Mapping**

| PSAction1 Cmdlet | Corresponding HTTP Method(s) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Get-Action1` | `GET` | Retrieves data from the platform without making any changes. |
| `New-Action1` | `POST` | Creates new items or resources, such as a new endpoint group. |
| `Update-Action1` | `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `POST` | Modifies, updates, or deletes existing items. |
| `Set-Action1[Keyword]` | N/A (Client-side) | Configures the local module's session state (e.g., `Set-Action1Credentials`, `Set-Action1DefaultOrg`). |
| `Start-Action1Requery` | (Likely `POST` to an action endpoint) | Triggers a request for the system to refresh its data from endpoints. |

This mapping provides a conceptual bridge for developers, demystifying the module by showing how its high-level commands correspond to the underlying HTTP methods of the REST API.

### 5.4 Practical Scripting Examples

The `PSAction1` module enables concise and powerful one-liners for common tasks:

*   **Retrieving all endpoints in the default organization:** [13]
    ```powershell
    Get-Action1 -Query Endpoints
    ```

*   **Filtering results using standard PowerShell syntax:** [4]
    ```powershell
    Get-Action1 -Query Endpoints | Where-Object {$_.name -like "A1-Sheep-*"}
    ```

*   **Getting a specific item by its unique ID, which is more efficient than retrieving all items and filtering:** [13]
    ```powershell
    Get-Action1 Endpoint -Id <endpoint_id>
    ```

*   **Updating a custom attribute on a specific endpoint:** [13]
    ```powershell
    Update-Action1 Modify CustomAttribute -Id '<endpoint_id>' -AttributeName "Custom Attribute 1" -AttributeValue "test this"
    ```## Section 6: Core Data Models and Schemas

To build effective and meaningful integrations, a developer must possess a thorough understanding of the structure and attributes of the data objects they are retrieving and manipulating. The Action1 ecosystem is centered around several core data models, with the `Endpoint` object being the most fundamental.

### 6.1 The Endpoint Object

The `Endpoint` object is the central data entity within the Action1 platform, representing a single managed device such as a server or workstation.[2, 11] The lightweight Action1 agent installed on each device is responsible for collecting a vast and detailed set of data, which is then made available through the API.[14] This object contains a rich set of attributes that provides a comprehensive IT asset inventory.

Key attribute categories of the `Endpoint` object include:

*   **Identifiers:** `id` (unique Action1 identifier), `name`, `comment`, `device_name`, `serial`, `MAC`.[13]
*   **Status Information:** `status` (e.g., "Connected"), `last_seen`, `online_status`, `reboot_required`, `agent_install_date`.[13]
*   **Operating System Details:** `OS_name`, `OS_version`, `OS_install_date`, `AD_organization_unit`.[13, 14]
*   **Hardware Specifications:** `CPU_name`, `RAM_total_GB`, physical memory, disk drive details, motherboards, firmware, and more.[13, 14]
*   **Software Inventory:** A complete inventory of installed software applications, including cloud storage apps, web browsers, and Windows drivers.[11, 14]
*   **Security Posture:** `missing_critical_updates`, `missing_other_updates`, antivirus status, and detected vulnerabilities.[10, 11, 14]
*   **User and Network Information:** `last_logged_on user`, IP addresses, network adapter details, and open network shares.[11, 14]

### 6.2 Custom Data Extensibility via "Data Sources"

A powerful and defining feature of the Action1 platform is its extensible data model, enabled through a concept called "Data Sources".[15] A Data Source is essentially a script-based template that can be executed across endpoints to query and retrieve custom information that is not collected by the agent by default. This transforms the platform from a tool with a fixed data schema into a dynamic and extensible infrastructure intelligence engine.

This capability was highlighted in a community discussion where a user requested detailed hard drive model numbers. An Action1 representative explained that if the desired information can be retrieved via a script, it can be collected as a Data Source and then included in reports.[16] This reveals a core design philosophy: while Action1 provides a rich default data set, the Data Sources feature provides a framework for user-defined data collection to cover any conceivable edge case.

While the primary API documentation does not list endpoints for programmatically creating or managing Data Sources themselves, the custom data collected by them is exposed through the platform's custom reporting features.[15] This implies that a developer could potentially retrieve this custom-defined data through API endpoints related to reports, if available.## Section 7: Advanced Considerations and Architectural Best Practices

Building a production-grade application requires looking beyond the basic API mechanics to address non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, and adherence to platform constraints. This final section covers critical considerations for architecting a robust, scalable, and compliant integration with the Action1 platform.

### 7.1 API Rate Limits

A thorough review of the available documentation reveals a critical information gap: there is no specific, published information regarding API rate limits for the Action1 platform. Production-grade APIs typically enforce rate limits (e.g., a maximum number of requests per minute) to ensure platform stability and fair usage among all clients. The absence of this documentation creates a degree of uncertainty and potential risk for developers, as an application making an excessive number of requests could be unexpectedly throttled or blocked without warning.

In the absence of documented limits, a defensive and "good citizen" approach to application architecture is strongly recommended:

*   **Implement Caching:** For data that does not change frequently (e.g., lists of organizations, software packages), implement a local caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls.
*   **Avoid Aggressive Polling:** Refrain from making requests in tight, continuous loops. If real-time updates are not essential, poll for new data at reasonable intervals (e.g., every few minutes).
*   **Implement Exponential Backoff:** In the event of a failed request or an error response (particularly a `429 Too Many Requests` or `5xx` server error), the application should wait for a short period before retrying. If the retry also fails, the waiting period should be increased exponentially to avoid overwhelming the server.

### 7.2 Licensing Model and API Implications

Action1 employs a compelling freemium licensing model that is a key component of its business strategy. The platform is perpetually free and fully functional for the first 200 managed endpoints, with no expiration date.[17, 18, 19] A paid subscription is required only for technical support and for managing any endpoints beyond this initial free allotment.

This licensing model has direct implications for the API. Endpoints that are added beyond the licensed count (whether free or paid) are automatically transitioned to an "Inactive" status.[19] While they remain in the system, they are no longer actively managed or assessed.

The API provides at least one endpoint related to licensing—a `POST` request to `/license/enterprise/trial`—which can be used to manage the trial status.[19] It is highly probable that other endpoints exist to check the overall subscription status, including the total number of licensed, active, and inactive endpoints.

Developers should consider building license-aware features into their applications. An integration could periodically use the API to check the license status and the count of active versus inactive endpoints. This would allow the application to provide value-add functionality, such as alerting an administrator when they are approaching their license limit, thereby improving the overall user experience and preventing unexpected service disruptions.
